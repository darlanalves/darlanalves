I've just read [this article](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNhFJjGcMPqpuYfxL62VVB9528NXqDNMFXiqN5bgFYiZ1/its-time-for-the-permanent-web.html) about a new protocol that seeks to replace the HTTP with a decentralized/distributed content network over P2P technology and a lot of other cool stuffs.

As the article states, this is totally crazy, and totally awesome! It may be as important as IPv6 is for the addressing problem. The new protocol can already be used with today's technology and there's even a gateway to use HTTP along with this new protocol.

Check it out! It's crazy!
